//cp.js - implement function spawnChildProcess that receives array of arguments args and creates child process from file script.js, passing these args to it. This function should create IPC-channel between stdin and stdout of master process and child process:
//child process stdin should receive input from master process stdin
//child process stdout should send data to master process stdout

const spawnChildProcess = async (args) => {
    // Write your code here
};

spawnChildProcess();
